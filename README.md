The task is to implement the K-NN method for density estimation. Obtain an iid
sample of N ≥ 1 points from a univariate normal (Gaussian) distribution centered at
1 and with variance 2. Choose a value for K, where 1 ≤ K ≤ N . Now, empirically
obtain an estimate of the density from the sample points using the K-NN method. To
show the estimated density, plot the computed density versus x for a large number
(e.g., 1000, 10000) of discrete, linearly-spaced x values. Please provide appropriate axis
labels. Produce separate plots for each of the following cases: (i) K = N = 1, (ii) K =
2, N = 10, (iii) K = 10, N = 10, (iv) K = 10, N= 1000, (v) K = 100, N= 1000, (vi) K
= N = 50,000.

### 2
Repeat the above task for the following mixture of two uniform densities: `f(x) = 0.4f1(x) + 0.6f2(x)` where `f1(x) = 1 if 2 <= x <= 3, 0 otherwiese`
and `f2(x) = 0.2 if 15 <= x <= 20, 0 otherwise`

### 3
Re-do Question 2 by the kernel method (use Gaussian kernel).
